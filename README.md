# Arrows
Final Project for Programming 12.

(Since this project was created before learning about OOP, some of the designs do not completely adhere to relevant design principles)

This is a single player 2D shooter game based on the mobile game Arrow.IO. It employs a manipulated A* algorithm for AI path seeking. Custom character sprites, various character skins and animated projectiles are all features of this game.
The game is created mainly using Python 2.7 and the Pygame Library.

Hope you enjoy it! :smile:
