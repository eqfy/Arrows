# Arrows
(Since this project was created before learning about OOP, some of the designs do not completely adhere to relevant design principles)

This is a single player 2D shooter game based on the mobile game Arrow.IO. It was created by Eric, Jeffery and Johnathan in 2018 out of interest on for the original game and was subsequently also submitted as a demonstration for python programming for the Programming 12 course. It employs a manipulated A* algorithm for AI path seeking. Custom character sprites, various character skins and animated projectiles are all features of this game.
The game is created mainly using Python 2.7 and the Pygame Library (Therefore, it also requires these two to run)

Hope you enjoy it! :smile:
